# GraphQL - Intro

Introduction to GraphQL by Alura.

## Using the Project

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Open a terminal window and load the mocks: `yarn start:mock`
3. Open another terminal window and start the app: `yarn start`

## Servers

- Mocks: `http://localhost:3000`
- Apollog GraphQL Studio: `http://localhost:4000`

## Branching

Branch `student` contains my personal solution following the instructions.

## Known Issues

Original application contains a bug that removes the `createdAt` property from
the user when `updating` one. This bug has been fixed in the `student` branch.
